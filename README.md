This Photon PUN project demonstrates how you can use PUN Interest Groups to implement a simple Area of Interest feature (reference: https://doc.photonengine.com/pun/current/gameplay/interestgroups).

- Find Assets/Photon/PhotonUnityNetworking/Resources/PhotonServerSettings.asset and fill the App Id PUN field with your Pun App ID created on Photon Dashboard (https://id.photonengine.com/).
- You can run this project from the Editor by entering Play Mode from Assets/Scenes/MainMenu scene.
- By building the project, you will be able to test it with multiple clients.
- Use WASD or the arrow buttons to move your character.
- On the master client, any cylinder that is being updated and synchronized to other clients are marked with green color.
- This Area of Interest implementation works with at most 8 players in theory.
- Kyle Robot asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/space-robot-kyle-4696
- You are free to use any idea or code from this project with or without modifications.
- If you need Area of Interest feature in your game, you may want to consider using Photon Fusion which has built-in Area of Interest support.
